            <p>
                My name is John P. Route. I am a student at the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp. I have two Bachelor's Degree, one in
                Information Technology and one in Business Adminstration from Regis Univeristy and an MBA from Colorado Technical
                University. I am a System and Network Administration Manager at Jack Henry and Associates. I manage 3 remote
                employees who live in the Monett Missouri area. I am taking this coding bootcamp program in order to assist
                in a career change from IT operations to software development / web development.</p>

            <p>I am also a scuba diving instructor with Denver Divers here in Denver Colo. I hold the rank of Master Instructor
                with Scuba Schools International. I am on the Denver Divers Training Committee and i am also a store monitor;
                a monitor is an instructor that monitors the classes taught by junior instructors and assistant instructors
                to ensure that everyone is teaching the materials properly, that they have all of the paperwork completed
                properly and that they are not putting students in danger.</p>
